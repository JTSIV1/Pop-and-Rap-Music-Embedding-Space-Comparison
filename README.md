# Pop-and-Rap-Music-Embedding-Space-Comparison

To use the code, access the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosgdcj/genius-song-lyrics-with-language-information). Download the data and place the csv titled `song_lyrics.csv` file in a folder called `Genius Data`. Then progress through the notebooks in order and the data will be trimmed, processed, and make into embedding spaced that are compared in the final notebook (notebook 4). Already trained models are present in the root folder and can be tested using notebook 4.
